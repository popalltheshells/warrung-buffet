Hello All, Ignatius here.
I was bored one day and decided to create a messy code for automation process that aggregates different stock analyst ratings from different sources.

Everything is messy, done in python. I had a plan to polish it and add more resources, but I haven't had the time to do it because of other projects that I have. Decided to make it open source and if there's anyone who wants to contribute, please do let me know.
